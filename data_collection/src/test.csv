Consultation launched to expand the role of construction project supervisors,img00000.jpg,The proposed amendments will allow project supervisors to better fulfil their responsibilities the Planning Ministry has said. File Photo: Chris Sant Fournier,"The Planning Ministry has announced a public consultation on proposed amendments to the law that regulates minimum health and safety requirements on construction sites, which includes a provision that will protect project supervisors from civil litigation.  In a statement, the ministry announced it was proposing a set of amendments to Legal Notice 88 of 2018, which it says will give the necessary powers at law to project supervisors to “fulfil their responsibilities”.  Anyone undertaking a development or construction project is obligated to appoint a project supervisor to oversee the design and execution of the project.  Among several responsibilities, the project supervisor must take account of the provision of health and safety on the job site, including drawing up a health and safety plan and overseeing its implementation.  The amendments, the Ministry said, will also include a non-liability clause which will prevent ‘duty holders’ from instituting civil proceedings or any other legal action seeking damages from a project supervisor for any action carried out in the pursuit of maintaining the regulations, unless the project supervisor is found to have acted in a negligent manner.  The roles and responsibilities of contractors, self-employed people and workers will be better explained “for added clarity”, they said.  A copy of the proposed amendments can be found on the OHSA’s website.  Comments on the rules may be made in writing to the OHSA at 17 Edgar Ferro Street, Pieta’ PTA 1533 or by email at ohsa@ohsa.mt by March 30.

PN to force vote on public inquiry into Jean-Paul Sofia construction site death,img00001.jpg,Sofia was the only fatality of the construction site collapse Photo: Johnathan Borg,"The PN will be forcing the government to vote on a public inquiry into the death of 20-year-old Jean Paul Sofia.  In a statement, Nationalist party leader Bernard Grech said the Opposition will be moving a parliamentary motion that asks for a ""public and independent"" inquiry into the death of Sofia.  “Our society needs to send a clear message that something as serious and tragic as this cannot be ignored,” Grech said on Tuesday.     Sofia was the only fatality of a building site collapse on December 3. He was found dead buried beneath the rubble of what was being developed into a timber factory. Five workers were rescued from the rubble, three of them seriously injured.  Calls for a public inquiry from the opposition and Jean Paul’s mother, have been ignored.   Asked in parliament whether a public inquiry will be launched into the death of the 20-year-old, prime minister Robert Abela skirted the question saying there was an ongoing magisterial inquiry and investigations by other authorities.   “If we really want justice, the work of these institutions should be allowed to be done in serenity,” Abela said earlier this month.  But the opposition will be forcing the government to choose whether to vote against a public inquiry or cave to pressure.     Speaking weeks after her son’s death Jean Paul’s mother Isabelle Bonnici called for a public inquiry into her son’s death.   Bonnici wants a public inquiry for the public authorities, herself, and her family to know what happened, with the hope that such a tragedy does not repeat itself.  ""My life’s mission was my only son,” Bonnici told Times of Malta, “now my mission is to bring justice for him,” she said.    Bonnici publicly called on the prime minister to meet her at the beginning of February.  Since then, she has taken to social media to reiterate her call for a public inquiry.   “I want to know exactly what happened and every person whose hands are stained with my son’s blood. Only a public inquiry can show the failings of the sector and give recommendations that might work,” she said on Saturday.  ",PN to force vote on public inquiry into Person construction site death

Six alleged burglars targeted Mrieħel warehouse three times,img00003.jpg,The law courts in Valletta.,"Six men were taken to court on Tuesday, accused of involvement in theft from an Mrieħel warehouse that was targeted three times.   The case dates back to October 15 last year when cigarettes and other items were stolen during the night from the Charles Grech warehouse at Mrieħel.  The same warehouse was also targeted in January but an apparent theft was foiled when an alarm went off.   Four days later, the same warehouses were targeted again and more cigarettes and other items were stolen. Police investigators working on CCTV footage and other evidence identified one of the suspects, Carlos Pace, of Marsa.  Eventually they arrived at identifying three other suspects. Later, police found stolen merchandise inside the car and shop of another suspect, Joe Mark Mercieca, 29 of Zabbar, who told the court that he is an environmental officer at ERA. Police eventually rounded up the six suspects, variously involved in the case.  During the arraignment, Carlos Pace, 21, from Marsa and Daniel Vella, 21, Zejtun, both pleaded guilty to theft. They were granted bail pending judgement, under a €5000 personal guarantee, They were ordered to sign the bail book once weekly. Mercieca was charged with handling stolen goods and defrauding government of due taxes. The other accused were James Azzopardi,  33, Hamrun,  Leon Calleja, 21, of Birkirkara, and Jonathan Degiorgio, 37, of Sta Venera. Azzopardi was also accused of theft of number plates, driving a Ford Transit without a licence and insurance cover as well as breaching four previous bail decrees. Degiorgio was also accused of breaching previous bail conditions. All pleaded not guilty. Degiorgio's lawyer, Franco Debono, requested bail. He pointed out that various factors militated in favour of bail. The accused had cooperated, played the least role, made a great change in life, and had got a job. The prosecution admitted that this suspect played the least role, telling police about his involvement in preparations for the theft without taking part in the actual robbery in January, He had however allegedly breached various previous bail decrees. Degiorgio had stepped out of jail after Christmas and was lucky enough to find a regular job. He previously had a drug problem which he seemed to be addressing. He had been making progress but then unfortunately landed in fresh trouble, explained Inspector Joseph Mercieca. ""The problem lies in the company he keeps""  Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit denied bail in view of the various charges, and alleged breach of previous bail decrees. The court directed a probation officer to follow the accused and report back to court under a temporary supervision order. Mercieca also requested bail, his lawyer pointing out that his case was different. He was not charged with theft but with handling stolen goods and breaching tax laws Bail was granted under various conditions, including prohibition to approach prosecution witnesses, signing bail book twice a week, a €500 deposit and a €5,000 guarantee. No request for bail was made at this stage in respect of James Azzopardi. Finally, Leon Calleja requested bail. His lawyer, Alessandro Lia, pointed out that charges in respect of his client were almost identical to those against the two who had registered an admission. The only difference was that he was charged with relapsing because of driving without a licence years ago. Finally, Leon Calleja requested bail.  Bail was granted under supervision by a probation officer, warning not to approach police witnesses, signing bail book three times weekly, curfew between midnight to 7:00 am, deposit €500 and a personal guarantee of €5000. Lawyers Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Francesca Zarb assisted Pace, Vella and Degiorgio.  Lawyers Michael Sciriha and Roberto Spiteri assisted Mercieca and Azzopardi. Lawyer Alessandro Lia assisted Calleja. Inspectors Joseph Mercieca, Christina Delia and Ritienne Gauci prosecuted. ",Six alleged burglars targeted Location warehouse three times
Tree planted in memory of Pelin Kaya uprooted by vandals,img00004.jpg,The oak sapling (left) was uprooted (inset) weeks after being planted in memory of murder victim Pelin Kaya. Photo: Friends of Villa Frere/Facebook,"A tree planted in memory of murder victim Pelin Kaya has been uprooted in an apparently random act of vandalism.  The oak tree was planted in Ta' Xbiex public gardens two weeks ago as a mark of respect for the Turkish woman. However, Friends of Villa Frere, an NGO that focuses on saving the historic estate in Pietà, revealed on Tuesday that it had been ripped out of the ground.  “I guess we were too hopeful... a few weeks isn't so bad by Malta's standards maybe...” the group wrote on Facebook.    “We planted it as a kind gesture and respect to her since she passed away so tragically,” a spokesperson for the NGO said. Although the oak tree was in her name, there were no plaques signifying the site, suggesting that it may have been a random act of vandalism.  The plant will soon be re-planted in Villa Frere’s own grounds “under our care and vigil,” they said. When the organisation originally planted the tree, they chose an oak because it is the national tree of Turkey and said they hoped it would flourish through the years.   Pelin, an interior designer, was walking in front of Paul & Rocco petrol station in Gżira at 1am on January 18 when she was struck and killed by a black BMW, driven by Jeremie Camilleri. He has since been charged with the murder of the woman, who died an hour into her 30th birthday. Friends said that she had been walking home from a little birthday celebration at the time. This is not the first murder-victim vandalism of the month as Paulina Dembska’s temporary memorial was scratched on February 1. Paulina Dembska, 29, was killed in Independence Gardens, Sliema, on January 2 last year. Abner Aquilina, 21, is pleading not guilty to the crime.

Watch: The 86-year-old on a mission to fix Malta’s pavements,img00006.jpg,"If it weren’t for her mobility scooter, Jenny Psaila would be housebound. Photo: Karl Andrew Micallef","Jenny Psaila is fed up. The 86-year-old recently bought a mobility scooter to help her navigate her way through St Julian’s and Sliema despite her advancing years. But her frustration is mounting as she keeps on bumping into tables and chairs, hitting cracks and having to drive alongside traffic in areas where there is no pavement at all. Instead of accepting her circumstances, she has come forward to highlight the situation facing anyone who relies on mobility aids and hoping something would be done to fix the problem. “Ouch,” Jenny says, as she drives over the fifth bump in the road while demonstrating her daily challenges to Times of Malta. “Driving the scooter in Malta is uncomfortable, to say the least… very uncomfortable.” The vibrations and jolts caused by the unevenness of the pavements sometimes lead to pains, especially in her neck.   Jenny relies on her scooter to retain an active life, saying that the mobility aid has given her “a new lease of life”. “If I didn’t have an aid (the scooter) I would be housebound,” she says.  An older friend of Jenny’s tripped on uneven pavements, leading to a fractured ankle which had to be operated on: “Her situation is not better and will never be better now.” A lot of people her age share stories like that, she says. Tiles on the Sliema promenade are often left displaced following maintenance works while tree roots lead to uneven surfaces.   However, “through trial and error,” she has learned how to get around in the smoothest way possible. But then there is another obstacle on the Sliema promenade, Jenny’s domain: it is often blocked by e-scooters, parked haphazardly, as well as tables and chairs set up by eateries.   The narrow walkways in some parts of her route also mean she needs to ask people to make way.   When she cannot use the pavement, either because it is too narrow, or because there are no ramps to get on, she is forced to join the traffic on the road. Jenny says that other elderly pedestrians stop to tell her it is a good idea to drive a scooter, but she is quick to warn them it is not for everyone.    “The first thing I say is, ‘Did you drive a car?’ because sometimes you have no choice but to drive the scooter on the road.”   To drive a mobility scooter, you need to know the rules of the road and feel confident enough, she says. Her 55 years of car driving experience help her remain calm when sharing the road with motorists. On a positive note, she has words of praise for motorists saying she is generally respected when on the road. “Most cars and particularly the buses are very good at giving way.” She is determined to continue getting around, despite the obstacles and is often seen driving around St Julian’s, Sliema and even Valletta which she gets to via the ferry crossing the Marsamxett harbour.   “Once I’m in Valletta I can go anywhere except the streets that have steps obviously,” she smiles.

"Marsascala set to bear the brunt of building boom, data for new permits shows",img00007.jpg,Marsascala is set to bear the brunt of the building boom.,"Marsascala is set to bear the brunt of the current building boom, with the biggest number of building permits for residences issued in the last quarter of 2022. Figures issued on Tuesday by the National Statistics Office show that between September and December last year, the authorities issued 357 building permits for a total of 2,064 new dwellings across Malta. Dwellings approved in Malta and Gozo increased by 35.0 per cent and 26.5 per cent respectively.  The highest number of approved new dwellings (203) was in Marsascala, followed by Victoria, Gozo, (188), St Paul's Bay (185), Marsaxlokk (132) and Siġġiewi (97).  On a regional basis,  the highest number of approved new dwellings was in the South Eastern district (515) while the lowest number was recorded in the Western district. Most of the new dwellings approved during the last quarter of 2022 were apartments (1,417), followed by penthouses (343), maisonettes (201), terraced houses (94) and other residential units1 (9) (Table 1). Apartments accounted for 68.7 per cent of the total number of approved new dwellings.   The NSO explained that while the number of building permits increased by just 0.3 per cent in the last quarter of 2022, the number of approved new dwellings increased by 33.2 per cent over the same period compared to 2021. That means that the average number of new dwellings per building permit stood at 5.8. ","Location set to bear the brunt of building boom, data for new permits shows"

HSBC Malta doubles its profit in a year,img00009.jpg,2022 was a good year for HSBC.,"HSBC Malta has reported a profit before tax of €57.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of €30.4m or 113% over 2021. It was the second strong performance in as many years, it having seen the profit rise by 157% in 2021 over 2020, a year impacted by Covid-19.  The bank said on Tuesday that the improved profitability was driven by rising interest rates, favourable market movements impacting insurance revenues, higher trading income, continued good progress on cost management and a significant recovery on a commercial non-performing loan. The directors are recommending a gross final dividend of 5.6% per share.  The bank said net loans and advances to customers decreased marginally by €21.6m last year from the previous one. But customer deposits increased by 6% to €5,971m at the end of 2022. The bank also reported a strong liquidity position with a stable advances-to-deposits ratio at 53%. Bank CEO Simon Vaughan Johnson hailed the performance. Looking ahead, he said the bank is making good progress on the transformation of its offices at 8 Mill Street, Qormi which is currently the largest real-estate project of its kind for HSBC in Europe. “This important capital investment in Malta will create a modern, fit-for-purpose business environment for all who work in or visit the campus and will facilitate a number of carbon net-zero initiatives that are fully aligned to our published targets.” On interest rates, he said the outlook for 2023 remains uncertain in view of heightened levels of inflationary pressures and continued geopolitical tensions.

HSBC say they 'inadvertently' doubled home loan down payment requirement,img00013.jpg,HSBC had slashed its maximum loan-to-value offered to 80 per cent from the previous 90 per cent last Friday. File photo,"HSBC Malta last week “inadvertently” doubled its minimum down payment for home loans on its website, the bank admitted on Monday. Times of Malta reported last Friday that the bank had slashed its maximum loan-to-value offered to 80 per cent from the previous 90 per cent. HSBC later issued a statement to the market to assure investors that it continues to offer home loans with a maximum of 90 per cent loan-to-value and that the website was updated to that effect. At the time, it gave no explanation for its backtracking. A spokesperson said on Monday: “The 80 per cent figure was inadvertently entered into our website and has since been corrected. “There has been no change in decision. The percentage was incorrect as we are still offering home loans at 90 per cent loan-to-value. “Like any other business, and in line with standard procedure, all credit decisions are made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration our internal lending criteria and risk appetite.” The loan-to-value figure represents the percentage of a property’s value that a mortgage lender is willing to provide, with the buyer required to make up the balance through a down payment. Times of Malta also reported that the bank had raised its interest rates for home loans by 40 basis points, moving the annual percentage change rate to 3.1 per cent from the previous 2.7 per cent. The spokesperson explained that interest rates on both loans and deposits were raised last month to “better align with current economic conditions”.

Cab driver fined €500 for 'stopping to use the bathroom',img00014.jpg,‘Drivers should be able to stop for a quick stop without facing the threat of a crippling fine’– eCabs. Photo: Chris Sant Fournier,"A group representing cab drivers is lobbying to soften a law that has cost some of them a €500 fine for parking legally and going to the bathroom for a few minutes. Transport Malta appears to be cracking down on Y-plated vehicles that are parked in public parking spaces, under a law that says they must be parked off-street or garaged when not in use.  One cab driver told Times of Malta he was fined for parking legally for no more than 10 minutes in Paola when he went to the bathroom before purchasing a soft drink. “It is my human right to go to the bathroom,” he said after being notified of the contravention for his “on-street illegal parking” last week.   Another cab driver stopped for a bathroom break on Sunday and found a ticket stuck to her car. “I was gone between two and five minutes,” she lamented.  “This law goes against workers’ rights. What will we do now in the summer heat? Can we not buy a bottle of cold water or drink?” she asked.   The relevant law reads: “An operator shall ensure that any light passenger transport vehicle used in his operations in terms of his operator’s licence shall always be garaged or parked off-street while not in use.” It goes on to attribute a €500 fine for the contravention.    A customer service agent at Transport Malta confirmed the law is being enforced. “The car must be driven all the time and cannot stop unless a passenger is getting in or out. Even if you stop to buy something, you can get a fine,” he said. The transport ministry later explained that in efforts to increase road safety and tackle abuse, Transport Malta had increased enforcement on the roads across the board, including enforcement on Y registered vehicles on which it had received complaints from people that these vehicles were parked on the road, especially during the night, illegally occupying parking spaces.  This legislation has been in place since October 2020, and there were no changes to the fines, it stressed. With regards to stopping for 'breaks', the ministry said the government ""is working to find a reasonable solution without opening up for abuse"". The Light Passenger Transportation Vehicles Committee, a lobby for cab drivers on ride-hailing platforms, has called for a system that would allow drivers to park in white boxes for a few minutes and have a break.   It proposes the use of a parking-time disc indicating at what time the car was parked and giving drivers a window to go to the bathroom or grab something to eat. Aron Gatt, a member of the committee, said this would allow drivers to stop for a few minutes of rest while adhering to the general principle that y-plate vehicles do not take up public parking spaces for long periods or overnight.   Ride-hailing platform eCabs has made a similar call. CEO Andrew Bezzina said that parking discs would give cab drivers a window to buy food, water and use the rest-room without facing the threat of a hefty fine.  “While we at eCabs agree with clamping down on abuse, we do not think that drivers should be unable to make a quick stop without facing the threat of a crippling fine,” Bezzina said. “That is why we are suggesting this parking disc solution.”  He added that eCabs had undertaken a significant investment to ensure that all its vehicles were parked in a privately owned facility when not in use. According to a 2020 Transport Malta booklet outlining regulations for Y-plate vehicles, a driver or fleet owner must declare they have sufficient space to garage their vehicle when not in use. But over the years this requirement has been systematically ignored, Gatt said. “Some operators have four cars but only a one-car garage, and others just have a P.O. box,” he said.  “We are against this kind of abuse,” Gatt added.

Bank customer loses thousands in number spoofing scam,img00015.jpg,Customers of Malta's two major banks are being targeted in the scam. Photo: Shutterstock,"A Bank of Valletta customer has revealed how he lost thousands of euro in a number spoofing scam after believing he had received an SMS from his bank.  The victim said he felt ""embarrassed"" to have been duped by the sophisticated cybercrime but decided to share his story to warn others. It started with an SMS from what appeared to be a genuine BOV number, which he had previously received authentic messages from. ""I'm usually very vigilant and aware of scams, but when I saw that the message was from the real BOV mobile number I assumed it was real,"" he said. The scam is known as number or ID spoofing.  In the scam message, the customer was warned that their mobile device has had its access limited for security purposes and asked to either visit a branch or re-authenticate their device by visiting the BOV website.   The message included a link to a fraudulent website where customers are instructed to verify their identity by logging into their BOV mobile app and carrying out a test transfer. Once the transfer is completed, money is withdrawn from the account.  Shortly after following the scammers’ instructions, money from the victim's account was transferred to what appears to be a Lithuanian bank account. ""A little while later I received the standard BOV SMS informing me that money had been transferred from my account. When I logged back into my online banking I could see that a large amount of money had been sent to a foreign bank"", he explained. People have also reported receiving similar messages claiming to be from HSBC. Contacted for comment, a BOV spokesperson warned that scammers often clone the mobile numbers used by banks to make their scams appear more genuine.   “Bank of Valletta is aware of a number of such scams. We advise the public to be vigilant at all times”, the spokesperson said. He said customer should question any SMS alerts containing links and instructions to divulge information or key in verification codes. For example if one receives an SMS stating that their order is ready for processing – and they are aware that they never placed an order with the company described in the link, than the cardholder should not act upon such an SMS. ""When in doubt the customer should always refer to their issuing bank to confirm whether the SMS is genuine or otherwise”, he explained. ",Bank customer loses thousands in number spoofing scam
Parishioners explain donations scheme for Marsaxlokk parish,img00016.jpg,Fr Luke Seguna. Photo: Facebook.,"Marsaxlokk parishioners testified on Monday how they used to make regular and voluntary donations to Marsasxlokk parish, as proceedings continued against former parish priest Fr Luke Seguna, who stands accused of allegedly swindling some 150 of his parishioners out of around €500,000 over a ten-year span. The 10 parishioners each gave similar testimony, but one made the point that a similar donations scheme had also previously existed under another parish priest. Fr Luke denies all accusations of fraud, misappropriation and money laundering.   Asked about their financial contributions “if any” towards the parish, each of the witnesses made reference to the ‘arbural’ scheme introduced by Fr Luke whereby a €10 monthly donation was collected. The priest would remind his parishioners about the scheme when making announcements at Mass. Some of the faithful would hand a €10 cash donation to the priest himself in the church sacristy or else gave the money to the parish secretary at her office and got a receipt in return. The donations fizzled out when the COVID-19 pandemic struck, forcing churches to close down. Some of the witnesses explained that they opted for a one-time annual payment of €120, mainly in cash or else by cheque. But all confirmed that they gave the money willingly for the funds to be utilised according to the needs of the Marsaxlokk parish. As court proceedings became repetitive, defence lawyer Jose’ Herrera asked why all those witnesses had been summoned by the prosecution.   “If 500 parishioners donated €10 a month, are we to have 500 witnesses here?”  Do we have the whole of Marsaxlokk [population] summoned here?” he asked. “That’s for the prosecution to decide,” rebutted AG lawyer Andrea Zammit. However, as one by one the line of witnesses came up with similar answers in reply to the prosecution’s line of questioning, the court pointed out that “20 or 300 witnesses saying the same thing” would produce the same outcome. “What is it that the prosecution wants to prove by producing this line of witnesses?”asked Magistrate Natasha Galea Sciberras. “That they [parishioners] gave donations and that the accused had total control,” explained AG lawyer Ramon Bonett Sladden. The testimonies continued along the same lines, except for one particular witness who recalled that “a long before the time of Fr Luke” parishioners used to donate funds for a new electrical system at the parish church. “So there were similar schemes before?”  Herrera, pouncing on that fresh snippet of information. “We used to donate Lm1…The money was collected by a woman….That was long before Fr Luke,” explained the witness. She could not recall the year but when asked what became of those donations, the witness remarked, “For the parish, no!” The case continues in March. AG lawyers Ramon Bonett Sladden and Andrea Zammit prosecuted. Lawyers Matthew Xuereb and Alex Scerri Herrera were also defence counsel.

Cathedral foundation sued over anniversary publication,img00017.jpg,The splendid interior of St John's Co-Cathedral.,"The former executive coordinator of the Valletta Rehabilitation Project, Ray Bondin, has filed libel proceedings against the president and the curator of St John’s Co-Cathedral Foundation, claiming that statements in a publication celebrating the 20th anniversary of the foundation are defamatory in his regard. The foundation was set up in 2001 following an agreement between the Government and the Catholic Church in Malta to oversee restoration and conservation projects as well as to manage the co-cathedral. To commemorate twenty years since its inception, the foundation published a book titled “St John’s Co-Cathedral: Looking After a Cultural Gem - 20 years of Restoration and Conservation.” Bondin, for twenty years or so after 1987, had been responsible for all major restoration projects undertaken at St John’s. The application was filed against Mgr Emanuel Agius and Cynthia De Giorgio as president and curator of the foundation respectively. Bondin said that the book contained various statements implying that works done under his tenure, although in good faith, effectively caused more damage. “Several parts of the Church and artefacts had undergone previous interventions to save them or brighten them up, however well intended, the results were often very unfortunate….”wrote De Giorgio on page 13 of the book. Citing that as an example, Bondin claimed that there were others, thereby making the publication defamatory in his regard. He called upon the court to award compensation for damages he claims to have suffered as a result of this publication. Lawyer Chris Said signed the application.

The result comes in the wake of a record year for fatalities on Malta’s roads, with 26 in 2022, and already three so far this year. There have been 83 road deaths since 2018, 29 of which involved the death of pedestrians, 14 of them aged over 65.   In fact, the study, by the University of Malta’s Faculty for Social Well-being, showed that those who worried most about serious traffic accidents were the 60 to 69-year-olds, followed by those aged 50 to 59, those aged 40 to 49 and the 70+ category. The government has promised to set up a transport safety commission to investigate the causes of fatal road accidents as part of a wider plan to make roads safer. The study looked into the perceived effect of traffic on the well-being of the Maltese population. Data was collected via telephone interviews administered to 400 Maltese citizens earlier this month. It was led by the dean of the Faculty for Social Well-being Andrew Azzopardi and deputy dean Gottfried Catania, with research support officer Annabel Cuff.   According to the study, three in every five people feel traffic increases their anger level, with women getting more irritated than men when stuck behind the wheel. Forty-six per cent of the respondents “strongly agreed” that being stuck in traffic makes them feel angrier, while another 15 per cent “agreed”. On average, women scored higher than men on a scale of how strongly they agree, ranking an average 5.3 compared to 4.8 for men. The study also showed anger levels were highest among those who were self-employed (with an average score of 6.3 out of 7). Forty-five per cent of respondents say the time they spend in traffic has an effect on their mood for the rest of the day. And 72 per cent say traffic tires them out. A total of 69 per cent also say they waste a lot of time in traffic which could be put to better use. The data further revealed that 82 per cent of respondents own a car but 65 per cent are worried about emissions from cars. The latest data shows Malta had the third-highest increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of eight per cent over the previous year. “The faculty has a duty to keep its hand on the pulse of our communities,” said Azzopardi. “Undoubtedly one of the challenges people speak about day to day is the impact that traffic is leaving on their social well-being. As a faculty we felt that it is the right time to seek the opinion of the general public on a number of specific issues related to this theme in a study… so that we can better inform public policy.” ","Frequency of road accidents has many people worried, survey finds"
