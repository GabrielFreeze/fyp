TODO:
• Look at comments I made in overleaf document
• Remove excess references (leave around 70)
• Fix document as per comments in tutor report [☺]
• Write Summary of Evaluation, Conclusion, Organisation of Document, and Abstract in that order
• Check for incosistencies in acronyms and terms (eg. pretrained vs pre-trained)
• Check for incosistencies in references
• Downplay influence of hamborg2019automated in Literature review
• Remove a lot of pages and make sure you fit in the page limit
• Fix broken referencees/links



Future work points
• as mention in labelling_wordchoice the one-dimensional positive-negative scale falls show of representing the complexity of news artcilees. A multi dimensional scale should be aplpied to the methodology for a more thoiurough evaluation
